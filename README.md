### Technical Skills <br>
**Machine Learning**: GenAI, LLM, PyTorch, Tensorflow <br>
**ML Tools**: Python, Langchain, LlamaIndex <br>
**Data Tools**: SQL, Snowflake, Streamlit, Airflow

### Projects <br>
[**Q&A Bot for a webpage using RAG**](https://github.com/swethag04/llm/tree/main/website-qna-app) <br>
The Q&A app provides answers to user's questions based on the content from the weblink provided by the user. The user inputs a website link and a question related to the content in the website and the app generates an appropriate response.
<br><br>
The app uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. It is implemented using Langchain modules to get all the contents from the webpage, convert the content into embeddings using OpenAI embedding model, store the embeddings in a Chroma DB vector database, and retrieve the answer based on the question provided by the user using OpenAI gpt-3.5 model.

[**Baby Name Generator**](https://github.com/swethag04/llm/tree/main/baby_name_generator) <br>
A simple web app using Streamlit that generates top 5 baby names given the baby's gender and nationality. The app was built using Langchain and OpenAI GPT3.5 LLM
